Ensure Maven is installed and set on Path
Ensure Postgres is Installed and set on Path


*Note terminal commands were done in Git Bash, not the regular terminal/powershell
To populate/repopulate this database, you can use a bash script with ./run_populate.sh
The password is "postgres"
After the database has been populated, you can run the application using a bash script with ./run_main.sh

When the application is running, the user has 4 options.
1: View the database
2: Add a new student entry
3: Update a student email
4: Delete a student entry

*Note, I am working on the final project with Dylan Nakamura 101306225.
I modelled this assignment off that, so our general setup may or may not be similar.
